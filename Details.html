            <h1>About Sweet Bee Ventures</h1>
            <p>
                This website, <b>Sweet Bee Ventures</b>, is a project created for testing and showcasing programming skills. It is a static website, meaning there is no database connected, 
                and there are no actual services or products for sale. Because there's no database, the website does not retain user information, and there is no login functionality. 
                However, certain data may be stored in your browser to improve the user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the website may use browser-based storage mechanisms like <b>cookies, local storage, or session storage</b> to remember your preferences or retain 
                temporary information across sessions. This storage is used to simulate functionalities like a shopping cart or to keep track of simple state information within the 
                same browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that these mechanisms do not involve the collection of personal information or sensitive data, nor do they allow us to track you accross different websites. 
                The stored data remains on your device and is not transmitted to external servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, the site may evolve into a fully functional business website, at which point services and products may become available. Stay tuned for updates, and you 
                will be notified of any changes to data storage and privacy policies.
            </p>
            <h3>Bee Removal services:</h3>
            <p>
                Please note that the phone numbers listed on the "Bee Removal" page are fictional and for demonstration purposes only. Do not attempt to call these numbers to request 
                bee removal services. If the website is updated to offer real services, the content information will be corrected to reflect actual service providers.
            </p>
            <h3>Order services:</h3>
            <p>
                The "Proceed to Checkout" button on the website only works if you have added items to your "Cart". However, this is merely a simulation. Items in the Cart are not stored 
                beyond the current session, and the website does not process actual orders. It is not possible to purchase products from this website.
            </p>
            <h3>Check Out services:</h3>
            <p>
                In the checkout section, several fields require specific formats (such as "Name on Card", "Card Number", "Expiration Date", and "CVV"). These fields are provided testing 
                purposes only, and no real transaction occur. You can use the following sample data to fill out these fields, "Name on Card:" use "Any name", "Card Number:" use 
                "1234567891023456", "Experation Date (MM/YY)" use "05/24", "CVV" use "123". Do <b>not</b> use actual credit or debit card information, as the website does not process 
                or store financial data. It is important to emphasize that this site in not intended for real transactions. Additionally, any items "purchased" on the website do not 
                represent actual orders, and no goods or services will be delivered.
            </p>
            <p>I thank you for understanding, noting that I will not be at fault for any problems arising from misuse of misinterpretation.</p>
